# WORDLE
Wordle is a well-known word-guessing game. The basic concept of the game is to guess the secret word in six tries, based on the color of the changing tile, which indicates the accuracy of our guess. By default, Wordle has a black and white color theme for dark and light modes. As a user, I wished it had more colorful themes. Therefore, as a developer, I decided to recreate the game with vibrant themes.

## User Experience

### First time player:

- As a first-time player, it's important to provide a clear introduction to the website's purpose and how to engage with it effectively.

- The game should offer straightforward instructions on how to play, ensuring new players understand the mechanics without confusion.

- Clear explanations should be given regarding the conditions for winning or losing the game, helping new players set their objectives.

- The user interface should be welcoming and intuitive, making it easy for first-time players to navigate and interact with the game.

- The aesthetics of the website should be simple and neat to avoid any distractions from the gameplay.

### Frequent Player:

- For frequent players, ensuring the website's responsiveness across various screen sizes is crucial for seamless gameplay experiences.

- Tracking and displaying the best scores across multiple sessions adds motivation for frequent players, allowing them to monitor their progress and strive for improvement.

- Offering a variety of colorful themes helps maintain engagement for frequent players, preventing monotony and enhancing the overall user experience.

- Implementing a toggle between dark and light modes caters to frequent players' preferences for comfortable viewing, especially during extended gameplay sessions.

- Facilitating easy game resets allows frequent players to quickly start new rounds, promoting replayability and continuous enjoyment of the game.

## Design

### Wireframes:

I made my wireframe for the game using Figma.

![Mobile-Wireframe]()
![Desktop-Wireframe]()

### Colour Scheme:

The primary enhancement to the game from its original version is the inclusion of themed color palettes for the tiles. Key colors such as purple, orange, blue, and red have been carefully curated for this purpose. In the light mode, gentle and muted hues of these colors were chosen to create a soothing visual experience for players.

Conversely, in the dark mode, deeper and richer shades of purple and blue were implemented to cater to players who prefer a very dark background. This contrasts with the lighter tones of orange and red, which offer a touch of brightness to the dark-mode interface without being overly intense. The goal was to provide options for players with varying preferences regarding the darkness of the background.

Throughout both light and dark modes, the emphasis was placed on avoiding excessively bright or harsh colors that could strain the player's eyes. By maintaining a balance between aesthetics and visual comfort, the game aims to enhance the overall gaming experience for players, regardless of their chosen mode.

### Typography:

Using the default "Arial" font for the game was a deliberate choice to maintain simplicity and clarity in the overall design. By opting for a widely recognized and easy-to-read font like Arial, the focus remains on the gameplay itself without introducing unnecessary distractions or complexities.

The decision to avoid excessive styling aligns with the goal of keeping the game's appearance clean and neat. Arial's straightforward and legible characteristics ensure that players can quickly interpret the text elements within the game interface without any hindrance. This approach fosters a seamless user experience, where players can engage with the game effortlessly without being overwhelmed by unnecessary design flourishes.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Navigation bar:
This is included across all three pages, and provides people with an easy reference to navigate between the 'Home', 'Services' 'Reviews' 'Portfolio' & 'Contact' pages.

![Navigation bar](https://i.ibb.co/sQL7hQM/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-36-13-am.png)

#### Landing Page:
The landing page has the Logo Image which is displayed like a cover image at the top of the Home page.

I photoshopped the image with the official logo of the makeup artists company Siihraz Shades Makeover in it. The logo image defines the feel of the website, providing the user with an image that they can easily associate to what the company is & does.

![Logo image](https://i.ibb.co/JFGw7ZD/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-37-33-am.png)

The About me section is listed right beneath the Logo Image. It has the photo of the makeup artist and a brief explanation about her and her work.

![About me](https://i.ibb.co/0sm59J5/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-39-43-am.png)

The Landing Page also got Services and Reviews in it.

#### Services

The Services section explains about the different services done by the makeup artist with a picture of a model and brief explanation about it underneath.

![Services](https://i.ibb.co/KqsjbNj/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-43-13-am.png)

#### Reviews

And when you scroll below the Services section, there comes Reviews section which has few reviews about the makeup artist given by her clients.

![Reviews](https://i.ibb.co/MgWbDrX/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-45-10-am.png)

#### Portfolio:
The portfolio page consists of masonry grid of images of makeup artist's clients to display her work. The images can be clicked to open and view. Below that, there will be a youtube video of the makeup artist working with her client. The masonry grid was made to present the portfolio pictures in a attractive way to the audience.

![Video](https://i.ibb.co/SK1Hpkq/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-48-36-am.png)

#### Contact:
The contact page consists of form to fill for the audience to reach out to the makeup artist for consultation and below that there is contact information of the makeup artist to book an appointment with her. In small devices like mobile I have added scroll bar for the contact information, as the mail id and address seems to be very large for small screens. A google map of her location is added below it.

![Contact Form](https://i.ibb.co/z2pfxdX/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-11-44-12-am.png)
![Contact Information](https://i.ibb.co/47D3s21/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-52-10-am.png)
![Google Maps](https://i.ibb.co/413TbGV/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-52-29-am.png)

#### Thank You Page
A customised 'form dump' page saying 'Thank You' has been included to Thank the users who took their time to fill out the form and share their information. The Thank-You page opens once the user clicks the send button after fulfilling the required information in the form.

![Thank-You-Page](https://i.ibb.co/sbRbsvn/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-11-32-56-pm.png)

#### 404 Error Page:
I have also added a customised 404 error page which can be seen when anything is typed at the end of the URL and pressed enter. This page would add a little fun element to the website and the users.
![404-Page](https://i.ibb.co/hWF49sB/Screenshot-2024-02-12-at-11-11-37-am.png)

#### Footer:
#### Social Links
Links of Facebook and Instagram will take to the makeup artist's social media page which can be found on the bottom of each page at the footer. Youtube and Twitter links will take the user to the respective social media platform in a new tab.

![Social-Links](https://i.ibb.co/6NhkFBf/Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-10-45-21-am.png)

#### Footer Comment
A comment has been added to the footer to indicate that the site is intended for educational purposes only. This has been done as the logo-image used was sourced from a google search, and I do not have the rights to the image. The image has been credited in this document.

### Future Features:
- Upgraded gallery with left and right buttons to navigate between images.
- A calender page of the artist to check her availability.
- A brochure of services provided by her with it's price range.
- To update with discounts during seasonal time.
- More rich and classy looking website.

## Testing and Challenges:
- I came across many challenges while creating this website. One of the major challenge which I kept facing again and again was positioning the contents in the centre of the page. Then after many trial and errors, I learnt to create a parent div and give flex values to it helped me to centre the content in many places.
- I was confused at many places about what unit to use for size of the contents. Then I figured out using percentage helps in places where responsiveness is needed and in other places I mostly went with pixels.
- Initially I struggled a lot with images since it was not uploading when I added it to the images folder and used it's relative path. Then I remebered studying somewhere in lessons about image hosting site. I googled about the same and came across "Imgbb.com" website for image hosting, which helped to host my image and solve all my issues with it.
- Whenever I felt like my code is not giving the desired style I want, I would google my query and mostly I would find my answer in it.
- For Portfolio I wanted to create a gallery which when clicked should open and display the full image. I found a YouTube tutorial for the same and followed it to achieve the desired result.
- Similarly, to create the Masonry Grid of my Portfolio too I followed a YouTube tutorial.
- In contact page, the contact information was too long for small screens, so when was confused about what to do, got an idea of adding scroll bar to overflowing content which was learnt in lessons helped.
- I was not aware of creating a form-dump page when clicked submit in the form, my mentor Martina pointed that out and after which I added a customised form-dump page to my form.
- It was quite hard designing 404 page when compared to others because any changes made to it can be seen only after deploying it in the github. So it took me more time designing this page for me when compared to others.
- I tested my website in all 4 screen sizes and which seems to work responsively without any error.
- I tested all my external links which also opens fine in new tabs.
- All my images seems to load perfectly without any delay in all browsers and devices.
- I tested my codes in validator, initially there was few errors about not to use "h1" anywhere other than main heading, stray tags, to use div instead of sections etc., and I corrected all those errors and recieved pass in the same for both HTML and CSS.
- Tested the site which opens in Chrome & Safari without issues.
